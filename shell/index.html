Teams
Join a team (either red or blue) and fight against the enemy eggs until your team has the most kills collectively.

Free For All
Every egg for themselves. If you see an egg, you shoot. Unless you want to be scrambled yourself. There is only one winner in this mode.

Captula the Spatula
Two teams battle for control of the spatula. The team with the spatula gets points for kills, but can lose them if the player holding the spatula dies.

King of the Coop
King of the Coop was added on December 1st 2021 with a host of cosmetic items and a new map. Two teams battle to capture a defined area known as the coop. The players on the winning team get 250 golden eggs each!

Weapons
There are seven main weapon types in Shell Shockers. Each weapon has its advantages and drawbacks. If you have eggcellent aim, a weapon like the Crackshot would be great. If youâ€™re more of a spray-and-pray type, try out the Whipper. The full weapon list for Shell Shockers is:

EggK-47 - classic medium-range automatic
Scrambler - high-damage shotgun
Free Ranger - semi-automatic sniper rifle
RPEGG - huge damage RPG
